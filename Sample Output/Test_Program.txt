RISC-V Program

Problem statement: Create an array in data memory starting at base address “0”. The array will hold 10 integer values 
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].Following instructions are stored in the instruction memory. Please execute the following program. 
Please ensure that your timing graph should show the following values, PC, Instruction, regfile, alu and data memory.

      addi  x31, x0, FFFFFFFF…F
      addi  x29, x0, x0 
      addi x28 x0 10
Loop: ld    x5, 0 (x29) 	
      xor   x5, x5, x31 	
      sd    x5, 0 (x29) 	 
      addi  x29, x29, 8
      addi x28 x28 -1 	 
BNE   x28, $zero, Loop
Exit
